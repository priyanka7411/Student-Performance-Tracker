# Student-Performance-Tracker

## Overview
The Student Performance Tracker is a data-driven web application built with Streamlit, Python, and Pandas to track and visualize the performance of students based on various attributes. It allows users to upload a CSV file containing student data, filter the dataset, perform basic data analysis, and visualize key insights such as the relationship between student performance and demographic factors.

## Features
CSV File Upload: Upload your student dataset in CSV format for analysis.

Data Filtering: Filter data based on gender, race/ethnicity, and other parameters.

Data Visualization: Visualize student performance using bar charts, pie charts, and line plots.

Save Filtered Data: Save the filtered dataset to a CSV file for further use.

Interactive UI: Easy-to-use Streamlit interface to interact with the dataset.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Programming language used for data processing and analysis.

Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web application.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.

CSV: Data format used for input and output.
